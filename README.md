# MERN-store

My first MERN stack web application. You are currently able to filter products, add products to your shoppingcart, edit the quantity of a product, remove a product from your shoppingcart, register an account, login to your account although there is currently no reason to have an account i just wanted to experiment with JWT.

DB_USER: MongoDB database user
